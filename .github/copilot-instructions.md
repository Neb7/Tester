**Indentation** should use tabs (size of 4 spaces) instead of spaces.
**Braces** for functions and control structures should be on a new line (except if only one instruction).
**White space**:
  - There should be a single space after keywords (if, for, while, etc.).
  - There should be no trailing white space at the end of lines.
  - You should use a tab after a function name in its definition (void  *exemple()).
  - You should put the "*" and "&" just before the variable name when declaring pointers and references (int  *ptr, int  &ref).
**Return statements** The value should be enclosed in parentheses (return (0);).
**Class** Must be in a canonical form (with basic constructors, copy constructors, assignment operator and destructor), except for abstract classes.
